Step1: You fork the project you wnat from git to your own git repo.
Step2: Create a git folder on local machine.
Step3: git init

-> If you want to see what has changed in your working directory, you can run

git diff

-> To view the changes that are staged in your working directory, use

git diff --staged

-> To look at the git activity, use the following. It'll show all of the activity.

git log

-> There's commit ID, and commit hash. If you want to compare a given commit and its previous commit,

git diff commitID^!

-> In order to compare between 2 commits,

git diff commitID otherCommitID

-> If you want to see the remote branches your local repo knows, you can use following to list all

git branch -a

-> So, if you are now confident that your local branch is now reviewed by your team, since you
pushed it to the remote branch, you now want to make that your main branch in your local system.

for that,

git checkout main

git merge branchname

Adding something just to test
